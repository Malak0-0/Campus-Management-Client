# Campus Management System: Client

This client-side of the Campus Management System built with the PERN stack—PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js. 
The frontend side of this project gives users a smooth, user-friendly way to view, add, edit, and delete campuses and students. 
From a simple, clean home page, users can explore all campuses or students, click into detailed views, and fill out forms with real-time validation errors.
The site uses React Router for navigation and Redux, helping users manage campus data efficiently.
